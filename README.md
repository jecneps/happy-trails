# happy-trails

an in-development Chrome extension that provides a [spatial model](https://darkblueheaven.com/spatialsoftware/) for web navigation, inspired by [Patryk Ada≈õ](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/lossless-web-navigation-spatial-model-37f83438201d/)

## Overview

Your web history should be a tree, not a list. Sometimes you follow a chain of links linearly, but everytime you open multiple links in a new tab, you are creating branching paths that your stroll through the Internet could follow. In all browsers creating new tabs divorces them from their history; they know not where they came from. 

## Setup

None, you are already complete :)
